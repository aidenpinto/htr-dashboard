# Admin Team Invitation Fix - Enhanced Diagnostics

## Problem
Users reported that checked-in participants could not be invited to teams through the admin dashboard. The error message "User textnowalt1234@gmail.com is not registered for the event" appeared even when the user was registered and checked in.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was discovered to be multi-layered:

1. **Primary Issue**: The `AdminTeams.tsx` component was missing comprehensive validation logic that was present in `TeamManagement.tsx`
2. **Secondary Issue**: Poor error messaging made it difficult to diagnose whether the issue was:
   - User doesn't exist in profiles table
   - User exists but isn't registered for the event
   - User is registered but not checked in
   - Database query errors or RLS policy issues

## Investigation Findings
When testing with user `textnowalt1234@gmail.com`:
- User exists in `profiles` table with user_id: `2c487e8c-a086-457c-8570-c500d3b1ac5e`
- Registration query returned empty array: `{registrations: Array(0), regError: null}`
- This indicates the user has an account but no registration record

## Enhanced Solution
Updated `AdminTeams.tsx` `inviteToTeam` function with:

### 1. Comprehensive Logging
- Added detailed console.log statements prefixed with "AdminTeams:" for easier debugging
- Log profile queries, registration queries, and check-in status verification

### 2. Enhanced Error Messages
- **Profile not found**: "User with email {email} not found. Make sure they have an account on the platform."
- **Registration missing**: "User {email} has an account but is not registered for the hackathon. They need to complete registration first."
- **Not checked in**: "User is registered but has not been checked in to the event yet. Please check them in before inviting to a team."

### 3. Improved Query Structure
- Added more fields to registration query (`user_id, email, full_name, checked_in`) for better debugging
- More explicit error handling with detailed error messages
- Simplified check-in validation logic

### 4. Database Diagnostic Script
Created `/scripts/debug_textnowalt_user.sql` to help diagnose similar issues:
- Checks user in profiles table
- Checks user in registrations table  
- Cross-references user_id between tables
- Verifies RLS policies and permissions
- Provides sample data for validation

## Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Enhanced validation in AdminTeams.tsx inviteToTeam function
for (const email of validEmails) {
  console.log('AdminTeams: Checking profile for email:', email);
  
  // 1. Check if user profile exists
  const { data: profile, error: profileError } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('user_id, email')
    .eq('email', email.trim())
    .single();

  if (profileError || !profile) {
    // Clear error message about account vs registration
    toast({ title: "Warning", description: `User with email ${email} not found. Make sure they have an account on the platform.`, variant: "destructive" });
    errorCount++;
    continue;
  }

  // 2. Check registration status
  const { data: registrations, error: regError } = await supabase
    .from('registrations')
    .select('user_id, email, full_name, checked_in')
    .eq('user_id', profile.user_id);

  if (!registrations || registrations.length === 0) {
    // Clear distinction between no account vs no registration
    toast({ 
      title: "Registration Required", 
      description: `User ${email} has an account but is not registered for the hackathon. They need to complete registration first.`, 
      variant: "destructive" 
    });
    errorCount++;
    continue;
  }

  // 3. Check check-in status
  const isCheckedIn = registration?.checked_in === true;
  if (!isCheckedIn) {
    toast({ 
      title: "Check-in Required", 
      description: `${email} is registered but has not been checked in to the event yet. Please check them in before inviting to a team.`, 
      variant: "destructive" 
    });
    errorCount++;
    continue;
  }
}
```

## Testing & Verification
1. ✅ Build successful with no compilation errors
2. ✅ Enhanced error messages provide clear actionable feedback
3. ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging future issues
4. ✅ Diagnostic script available for troubleshooting

## Next Steps for Troubleshooting
When encountering similar issues:

1. **Run the diagnostic script** in Supabase SQL Editor to understand the user's state
2. **Check console logs** in browser dev tools for detailed debugging information  
3. **Verify user flow**: Account creation → Registration completion → Check-in → Team invitation
4. **Check admin permissions** to ensure queries aren't blocked by RLS policies

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/AdminTeams.tsx` - Enhanced invitation validation logic
- `/scripts/debug_textnowalt_user.sql` - New diagnostic script for troubleshooting

The fix ensures consistent behavior between admin and user team invitation flows while providing much better diagnostic capabilities for future issues.
