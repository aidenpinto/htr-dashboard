# Notification Visibility Features

## New Features Added

### 1. Quick Visibility Toggle
- **Eye/Eye-off button** in the actions column of each notification
- Quickly hide/show notifications without editing
- Visual feedback with appropriate icons:
  - üëÅÔ∏è Eye icon for visible notifications  
  - üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Eye-off icon for hidden notifications
- Tooltip shows current action: "Hide from participants" or "Show to participants"
- Success toast confirms the action

### 2. Visibility Filters
Added filter buttons to view different notification states:
- **All**: Shows all notifications (default)
- **Visible**: Shows only notifications visible to participants (is_active = true)
- **Hidden**: Shows only hidden notifications (is_active = false)
- **Badge counter** shows count of filtered notifications

### 3. Improved Form Labels
- Changed "Active" label to "Visible to participants" 
- Added description: "When enabled, this notification will be visible to all participants"
- Makes the purpose much clearer for admins

### 4. Contextual Empty States
- Different empty state messages based on active filter:
  - "No global notifications created yet." (All filter)
  - "No visible notifications found." (Visible filter)  
  - "No hidden notifications found." (Hidden filter)

## How It Works

### For Participants:
- Only see notifications where `is_active = true`
- Hidden notifications are completely filtered out
- No change in user experience for visible notifications

### For Admins:
- Can see all notifications regardless of status
- Visual status indicators (Active/Inactive badges)
- Quick toggle buttons for immediate hide/show
- Filter view to focus on specific visibility states
- Clear form controls when creating/editing

## Use Cases

1. **Testing**: Hide notifications while testing without deleting them
2. **Scheduling**: Prepare notifications but keep them hidden until ready
3. **Maintenance**: Temporarily hide outdated notifications  
4. **Organization**: Use filters to review visible vs hidden notifications
5. **Quick Management**: Toggle visibility without full edit workflow

## Technical Implementation

- Uses existing `is_active` boolean field in database
- Client-side filtering in admin interface  
- Server-side filtering in user-facing components
- Real-time updates when toggling visibility
- Proper error handling and user feedback

The notification visibility system is now fully functional with intuitive admin controls!
