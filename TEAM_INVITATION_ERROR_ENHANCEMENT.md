# Team Invitation Error Handling Enhancement

## Changes Made

The team management component has been enhanced to provide better error handling when checked-in users try to invite non-checked-in users to their team.

### 1. Enhanced Error State Management

- Added `inviteErrors` state array to track invitation errors
- Errors are collected during the invitation process and displayed persistently in the UI

### 2. Improved Visual Feedback

- Added a prominent error alert that appears above the invitation form
- Shows specific error messages for each failed invitation attempt
- Uses destructive styling (red) to clearly indicate errors
- Errors are automatically cleared when users start typing in email fields

### 3. Better Error Categorization

- Non-checked-in users: "email has not been checked in to the event yet and cannot be invited to a team."
- Non-registered users: "User with email email not found. Make sure they have registered on the platform."
- Non-registered for event: "User email is not registered for the event."
- General invitation failures: Shows specific error messages from the database

### 4. Enhanced User Experience

- Errors persist until user starts typing new emails
- Toast notifications still appear for immediate feedback
- Success messages differentiate between full success and partial success
- Users can see exactly which emails failed and why

## How It Works

1. **User enters email addresses** and clicks "Send Invites"
2. **System validates each email**:
   - Checks if user exists in profiles table
   - Checks if user is registered for the event
   - **Checks if user is checked in** (this is the key enhancement)
3. **For non-checked-in users**:
   - Error is added to the `inviteErrors` state array
   - Toast notification shows immediately
   - Invitation is skipped for that user
4. **Error display**:
   - Persistent error alert shows above the invitation form
   - Lists all failed invitations with specific reasons
   - Automatically clears when user starts typing new emails

## Testing Scenario

To test the non-checked-in user invitation error:

1. **Setup**: Have two users - User A (checked in) and User B (not checked in)
2. **Login as User A** (checked-in user)
3. **Create a team** or be a team leader
4. **Try to invite User B** using their email address
5. **Expected Result**: 
   - Toast notification appears: "email has not been checked in to the event yet and cannot be invited to a team."
   - Persistent error alert appears above the invitation form
   - Error message clearly states the user cannot be invited because they're not checked in

## Code Changes Summary

### TeamManagement.tsx
- Added `inviteErrors` state for persistent error tracking
- Enhanced `inviteMembers()` function to collect and display errors
- Added error clearing in `updateEmailField()` function
- Added visual error alert component in the invitation form
- Improved success/failure messaging logic
- **Fixed registration check bug**: Removed `.single()` query method that was causing false "not registered" errors

The system now provides much clearer feedback when invitation attempts fail due to check-in status or other reasons.

## Bug Fix: Registration Check Issue

### Problem
The original code used `.single()` when querying the registrations table, which expects exactly one result. This caused the query to fail with an error when:
- A user had multiple registrations (edge case)
- The query execution encountered any database issues
- The result set was unexpected

### Solution
Changed the registration check from:
```typescript
const { data: registration, error: regError } = await supabase
  .from('registrations')
  .select('checked_in')
  .eq('user_id', profile.user_id)
  .single(); // This was causing the issue
```

To:
```typescript
const { data: registrations, error: regError } = await supabase
  .from('registrations')
  .select('checked_in')
  .eq('user_id', profile.user_id); // Removed .single()

// Then handle the array properly
if (!registrations || registrations.length === 0) {
  // User not registered
}
const registration = registrations[0]; // Get first result
```

This approach is more robust and matches how other components (like AdminRegistrations) handle the registrations table.
