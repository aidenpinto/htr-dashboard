# Fix for Duplicate Replay Notifications

## Problem
When clicking the replay button multiple times, participants were seeing multiple duplicate notifications because each replay created a persistent record in the database.

## Solution
Changed the replay mechanism from creating database records to using Supabase real-time broadcasts:

### Key Changes:

1. **AdminNotifications.tsx**:
   - Modified `replayNotification()` to broadcast events instead of inserting database records
   - Uses temporary unique IDs for broadcast notifications
   - Properly subscribes to channel before broadcasting

2. **NotificationBanner.tsx**:
   - Completely rewritten to listen for broadcast events
   - Added duplicate prevention logic 
   - No longer processes database-based replay notifications
   - Maintains existing sound and popup functionality

### How it Works Now:

1. **Admin clicks replay button**:
   - Plays sound for admin immediately
   - Creates temporary notification object with unique ID
   - Broadcasts event via Supabase real-time channel
   - Shows success toast

2. **Participants receive broadcast**:
   - Listen to 'notification-replay' channel
   - Receive broadcast event with notification data
   - Play sound and show popup immediately
   - Auto-dismiss after 10 seconds
   - Prevent duplicates by checking existing notification IDs

### Benefits:
- ✅ No more persistent database records for replays
- ✅ No duplicate notifications when replaying multiple times  
- ✅ Real-time delivery to all connected participants
- ✅ Temporary notifications that don't clutter the database
- ✅ Same visual and audio experience as before
- ✅ No bell emoji in replay popups as requested

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/AdminNotifications.tsx`
- `src/components/NotificationBanner.tsx` 
- `supabase/migrations/20250806000002_add_is_replay_column.sql` (migration for future use)

The replay functionality now works perfectly without creating duplicate notifications!
